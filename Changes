      subclasses via signature_error_handler().
      [github #54]

      [github #60]

20121025.2315_001    Thu Oct 25 23:15:20 PDT 2012
    New Features

    Incompatible Changes

      [github #26]

    New Features
    * Now checking if there are too many arguments. [github #23]
    * Run-time errors are now class methods, so subclasses can override them.
    * Method::Signatures::Modifiers allows you to use Method::Signatures
      with MooseX::Declare and apply method modifiers like before, after
      and around. [Buddy Burden] [github #14]
    * compile_at_BEGIN option controls if "method" and "func" are compiled
      like normal statements or early like "sub". [github #8]

    Bug Fixes
    * Now depending on a version of Devel::Declare that works with
      5.13 and up. [github #10]
    * Now depending on a known good version of Mouse. [github #17]
    * Improved error messages reporting from the right position in the
      user's code. [Buddy Burden]

      passed in. [github #12]
    * Depending on a new version of Devel::Declare that works with perl
      5.13 and up. [github #10]
    * Fix some cases where a compile time error will show up as an error
      inside PPI.

    Docs
    * Many grammar fixes and prose improvements [Noirin Plunkett] [github #25]
    * Slurpy parameters are clearly documented
    * The rules if a parameter is required or optional are more clear
    * Clarify that func() has no invocant [github #32]
    * Mention METHOD_SIGNATURES_DEBUG environment variable for debugging.
      [github #32]
    * Documented the "debug" option.
    * Documented issues with 5.8 and compile_at_BEGIN. [github #8] [github #22]

    Test Fixes

      different errors on compilation failure. [github #18]
    * Tests will no longer fail on 5.8. [github #22]


20110324.1600_001  Thu, 24 Mar 2011 16:00:38 +1100

    * Added support for Perl 6 style type syntax backed by Any::Moose

    * Data::Alias is no longer optional.  It's been fixed and is now
      maintained.  Aliasing will now always work.

    Misc
    * Use Const::Fast to implement read only arguments.  This avoids the
      optional Readonly::XS to make it fast.


20100730  Fri Jul 30 12:54:20 PDT 2010
    New Features
    * Added func() to handle functions.

    Incompatible Changes
    * Data::Alias is now optional.  This is because it does not work in 5.12
      and there's no fix in sight.  If you want to use aliasing in your
      distribution it will have to depend on Data::Alias itself.

    Docs
    * Updated the SEE ALSO
    * Removed the assertion that no checks are done on the signature


20090620  Sat Jun 20 01:26:59 PDT 2009

      parse better.  (thanks to Florian Ragwitz)

    Other
    - Repository moved to github.
    - Changing to ISO date versions.


0.11  Sat Sep 27 16:47:51 EDT 2008
    New Features

      built in prototypes.


0.05  Sun Sep 21 15:17:16 PDT 2008
    Bug Fixes
    * methods now get the right name in caller(), not "Class::__ANON__".
    * The \@foo prototype no longer has a performance hit
    * Closures now work with \@foo
      (All the above thanks to Matthijs van Duin and his Sub::Name and
       Data::Alias)

    Test Fixes
    * Not rigorously checking the bitmask and hints flags from caller() as
      their behavior is undefined.  This fixes the 5.10 test failures.


0.04  Sun Sep 21 13:52:29 PDT 2008
    New Features
    * A \@foo protototype allows you to use a reference as a regular var

    New Docs
