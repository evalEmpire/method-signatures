    * Run-time errors are now class methods, so subclasses can override them.
    * Method::Signatures::Modifiers allows you to use Method::Signatures
      with MooseX::Declare and apply method modifiers like before, after
      and around. [Buddy Burden] [github #14]
    * compile_at_BEGIN option controls if "method" and "func" are compiled
      like normal statements or early like "sub". [github #8]

    Bug Fixes
    * Now depending on a version of Devel::Declare that works with
      5.13 and up. [github #10]
    * Now depending on a known good version of Mouse. [github #17]
    * Improved error messages reporting from the right position in the
      user's code. [Buddy Burden]

      5.13 and up. [github #10]

      inside PPI.

    Docs
    * Many grammar fixes and prose improvements [Noirin Plunkett] [github #25]
    * Slurpy parameters are clearly documented
    * The rules if a parameter is required or optional are more clear
    * Clarify that func() has no invocant [github #32]
    * Mention METHOD_SIGNATURES_DEBUG environment variable for debugging.
      [github #32]
    * Documented the "debug" option.

    * Data::Alias is no longer optional.  It's been fixed and is now
      maintained.  Aliasing will now always work.

    Misc
    * Use Const::Fast to implement read only arguments.  This avoids the
      optional Readonly::XS to make it fast.


20100730  Fri Jul 30 12:54:20 PDT 2010
    New Features
    * Added func() to handle functions.

    Incompatible Changes
    * Data::Alias is now optional.  This is because it does not work in 5.12
      and there's no fix in sight.  If you want to use aliasing in your
      distribution it will have to depend on Data::Alias itself.

    Docs
    * Updated the SEE ALSO

      built in prototypes.


0.05  Sun Sep 21 15:17:16 PDT 2008
    Bug Fixes
    * methods now get the right name in caller(), not "Class::__ANON__".
    * The \@foo prototype no longer has a performance hit
    * Closures now work with \@foo
      (All the above thanks to Matthijs van Duin and his Sub::Name and
       Data::Alias)

    Test Fixes
    * Not rigorously checking the bitmask and hints flags from caller() as
      their behavior is undefined.  This fixes the 5.10 test failures.


0.04  Sun Sep 21 13:52:29 PDT 2008
    New Features
    * A \@foo protototype allows you to use a reference as a regular var
